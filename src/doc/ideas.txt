- deckbuilding: find ways to encourage players to use weak but fun cards
  - have a deck building budget, cards being balanced over time (e.g. Gwent but not tied to rarity, or Warhammer armies)
  - these cards sneak into the games (e.g. a character make extra cards appear in both players hands, e.g. HS discover)

- land ruins: lands have 2 faces, the second is the destroyed version, doesn't block but has an effect, e.g. to discourage piling up on that row

- card type: buildings, several types:
  - lands upgrades, "enchant row", destroyed with the land or remains on the ruins
  - backline buildings, a la planeswalker, can be attacked if a unit can breach
  - they would use gold as a parallel economy
  - cell upgrades, very simple effects only identified as borders (fire, regen, armor, buff...)

or mix the above with lands, and pick 4 as your starting lineup ?

store excess mana for next turn but only for non snowbally things? e.g. Runeterra
if no mana color was upgraded, gain gold, instead of card draws?
excess mana -> gold
gold could be used in a "shop" with various NPCs proposing services
the shop would have varied options, random from a pool, but the same during the whole game (e.g. Snap locations)
gold can be used for non cards abilities, which are non snowbally in nature / catchup mechanics 
 - draw / loot / tutor / discover
 - repair / heal lands and player
 - meta gains? (collection...)
 - big splashy catchup mechanics (e.g. wrath)
